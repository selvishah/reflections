When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    to share with other folks who might be using the same files

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    so that it doesnt accidently overwrite the changes that you might be working on. Or the changes might still be work in progress
and you want to pull them once they are done

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branch is for creating a new branch from the last commit
    clones is for creating a clone of a repository on your local machine
    fork is for creating a copy of someones repository on github itself.

Fork will be used if you want to use someone's repository and make changes on top of that without modifying the existing version
clone will be used if you want a local copy of a repository on your machine and make that the remote to which you can push and pull
Branch works on existing repository where say you want to add an expiremental feature and dont want to commit it on the main branch until its functional
